Alice wants to buy a fancy NFT. 
She is new to this funky jpeg on chain thing but there is this cute cat Bob showed her, and there are only 22222 cute cats left to mint. Mint? 
Alice needs some more ETH (quite expensive these cute cats) ... she chooses ecoSwap a project, planting a tree for every transaction executed on their platform, to swap USCD for ETH. ðŸŒ³
Alice can mint her cute cat. Guess what, cute cats plant a tree for every mint. ðŸŒ³
Alice is stoked about her new cat. She would like to let everyone know that she is now a cute cat as well. Alice changed her profile pic and posts about her cat on ecoLens, a web3 social media project rewarding users with mintable trees (resolving in planted trees).
Alice is lucky her post was the 100th -> she got a notification, that ecoLens rewards her with 10 trees on minttrees.xyz. ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³
1 cute cat + 10 + 2 trees, what a day. 
Alice informed herself about the planting tree partners mint trees works with. 
Alice, still on minttrees.xyz, would like to help decarbonising the world a bit more and plants another 100 trees with some of her remaining USDC.
