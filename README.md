# Mint Trees

## The Story

Alice wants to buy a fancy NFT.  Alice needs some more ETH and chooses ecoSwap a project, planting a tree for every transaction executed on their platform, to swap USCD for ETH. ðŸŒ³

Alice can mint her cute cat. Guess what, cute cats plant a tree for every mint. ðŸŒ³

Alice is stoked about her new cat. She would like to let everyone know that she is now a cute cat as well. Alice changed her profile pic and posts about her cat on ecoLens, a web3 social media project rewarding users with mintable trees (resolving in planted trees).

Alice is lucky her post was the 100th -> she got a notification, that ecoLens rewards her with 10 trees on minttrees.xyz. ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³

1 cute cat + 10 + 2 trees, what a day. 

Alice informed herself about the planting tree partners mint trees works with. 

Alice, still on minttrees.xyz, would like to help decarbonising the world a bit more and plants another 100 trees with some of her remaining USDC.
